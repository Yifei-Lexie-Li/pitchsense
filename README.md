## 🧠 Executive Summary

PitchSense addresses the inefficiencies of traditional fundraising. By leveraging AI, it accelerates investor matching, generates tailored outreach materials, and manages communication pipelines end-to-end. The result: faster outreach, higher relevance, and better outcomes for founders.

PitchSense was originally developed at [AgentHacks 2025](https://www.agenthacks.org), a leading hackathon focused on responsible, agentic AI systems. The event was hosted by [Dex](https://meetdex.ai/) and [AfterQuery](https://www.afterquery.com/)—both **Y Combinator-backed startups**—alongside [AGI House](https://www.agihouse.org), bringing together over 500 attendees to tackle real-world problems with intelligent agents. PitchSense was awarded **Most Impactful Project** for its practical relevance, clean UX, and strong technical execution.

This project was developed as part of the research track **Interfaces for Human-AI Collaboration** — focused on designing HCI interactions where AI doesn’t just automate, it collaborates.

## 🚩 The Challenge
Traditional fundraising involves manual investor discovery, generic pitches, and fragmented outreach tracking. This inefficiency wastes valuable founder time and resources, reducing their focus on core business growth.

---

## 🔄 How It Works
1. **Investor Matching Engine**
   - Captures founder details (sector, stage, traction)
   - Uses semantic search with OpenAI Embeddings and FAISS
   - Provides ranked investor recommendations

2. **Dynamic Pitch Generator**
   - Customizes pitch decks and emails using GPT-4
   - Provides confidence tags for human oversight

3. **Outreach Management**
   - CRM-lite tracking system (Airtable/Notion integration)
   - Status indicators: Contacted, Replied, Intro Requested

---

## 💡 Innovation Highlights
- **Smart Matchmaking:** Highly relevant, personalized investor recommendations  
- **AI-enhanced Communication:** Human-like tone, avoiding robotic phrasing  
- **Integrated Outreach Tracking:** Real-time CRM synchronization for transparency  
- **Human-AI Collaborative Interface (HCI):** Seamlessly integrates human judgment with AI suggestions, enhancing decision-making and trust.
